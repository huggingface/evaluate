# Evaluate on the Hub

You can evaluate AI models on the Hub in a multiple ways and this page will guide you through the different options:

- **Community Leaderboards** bring together the best models for a given task or domain and make them accessible to everyone.
- **Model Cards** provide a comprehensive overview of a model's capabilities from the author's perspective.
- **Libaries and Packages** give you the tools to evaluate your models on the Hub.

## Community Leaderboards

Community leaderboard show how a model performs on a given task or domain. For example, their are leaderboards for question-answering, reasoning, classification, vision, and audio. If you're tackling a new task, you can use a leaderboard to see how a model performs on it.

Here are some examples of community leaderboards:

| Leaderboard | Task | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)| Embedding | MTEB leaderboard compares 100+ text and image embedding models across 1000+ languages. We refer to the publication of each selectable benchmark for details on metrics, languages, tasks, and task types. Anyone is welcome to add a model, add benchmarks, help us improve zero-shot annotations or propose other changes to the leaderboard. |
| [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard)| Agentic | GAIA is a benchmark which aims at evaluating next-generation LLMs (LLMs with augmented capabilities due to added tooling, efficient prompting, access to search, etc). (See our paper for more details.) |
| [OpenVLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/opencompass/open_vlm_leaderboard)| Vision Language Models | The OpenVLM Leaderboard evaluates 272+ Vision-Language Models (including GPT-4v, Gemini, QwenVLPlus, LLaVA) across 31 different multi-modal benchmarks using the VLMEvalKit framework. It focuses on open-source VLMs and publicly available API models. |
| [Open ASR Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hf-audio/open_asr_leaderboard)| Audio | The Open ASR Leaderboard ranks and evaluates speech recognition models on the Hugging Face Hub. Models are ranked based on their Average WER, from lowest to highest. |
| [LLM-Perf Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/llm-perf/leaderboard)| LLM Performance | The 🤗 LLM-Perf Leaderboard 🏋️ is a leaderboard at the intersection of quality and performance. Its aim is to benchmark the performance (latency, throughput, memory & energy) of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different hardwares, backends and optimizations using Optimum-Benhcmark. |

There are tonnes more leaderboards on the Hub. Check out all the leaderboards via this [search](https://huggingface.co/spaces?category=model-benchmarking) or use this [dedicated space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenEvals/find-a-leaderboard) to find a leaderboard for your task.

## Model Cards

Model cards provide an overview of a model's capabilities evaluated by the model's author. They are a great way to understand a model's capabilities and limitations.

Unlike leaderboards, model card evaluation scores are not created openly by the community.

<Tip>

For information on reporting results, see details on [the Model Card Evaluation Results metadata](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards#evaluation-results).

</Tip>

## Libaries and Packages

There are a number of open-source libraries and packages that you can use to evaluate your models on the Hub. These are useful if you want to evaluate a custom model or with a custom evaluation task.

### 🤗 Evaluate

A library for easily evaluating machine learning models and datasets.

With a single line of code, you get access to dozens of evaluation methods for different domains (NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and more!). Be it on your local machine or in a distributed training setup, you can evaluate your models in a consistent and reproducible way! 

Visit the 🤗 Evaluate [organization](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-metric) for a full list of available metrics. Each metric has a dedicated Space with an interactive demo for how to use the metric, and a documentation card detailing the metrics limitations and usage.
