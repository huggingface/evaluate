# Metric Card for Brier Score


## Metric Description
Brier score is a type of evaluation metric for classification tasks, where you predict outcomes such as win/lose, spam/ham, click/no-click etc.
`BrierScore = 1/N * sum( (p_i - o_i)^2 )`

Where `p_i` is the prediction probability of occurrence of the event, and the term `o_i` is equal to 1 if the event occurred and 0 if not. Which means: the lower the value of this score, the better the prediction. 
## How to Use

At minimum, this metric requires predictions and references as inputs.

```python
>>> brier_score = evaluate.load("brier_score")
>>> predictions = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
>>> references = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.3])
>>> results = brier_score.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
```

### Inputs

Mandatory inputs: 
- `predictions`: numeric array-like of shape (`n_samples,`) or (`n_samples`, `n_outputs`), representing the estimated target values.

- `references`: numeric array-like of shape (`n_samples,`) or (`n_samples`, `n_outputs`), representing the ground truth (correct) target values.

Optional arguments:
- `sample_weight`: numeric array-like of shape (`n_samples,`) representing sample weights. The default is `None`.
- `pos_label`: the label of the positive class. The default is `1`.
        

### Output Values
This metric returns a dictionary with the following keys:
- `brier_score (float)`: the computed Brier score.


Output Example(s):
```python
{'brier_score': 0.5}
```

#### Values from Popular Papers


### Examples
```python
>>> brier_score = evaluate.load("brier_score")
>>> predictions = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
>>> references = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.3])
>>> results = brier_score.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
>>> print(results)
{'brier_score': 0.3375}
```
Example with `y_true` contains string, an error will be raised and `pos_label` should be explicitly specified.
```python
>>> brier_score_metric = evaluate.load("brier_score")
>>> predictions =  np.array(["spam", "ham", "ham", "spam"])
>>> references = np.array([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.3])
>>> results = brier_score.compute(predictions, references, pos_label="ham")
>>> print(results) 
{'brier_score': 0.0374}
```
## Limitations and Bias
The [brier_score](https://huggingface.co/metrics/brier_score) is appropriate for binary and categorical outcomes that can be structured as true or false, but it is inappropriate for ordinal variables which can take on three or more values.
