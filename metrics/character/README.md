description: >-
  CharacTer is a novel character level metric inspired by the commonly applied translation edit rate (TER). It is
defined as the minimum number of character edits required to adjust a hypothesis, until it completely matches the
reference, normalized by the length of the hypothesis sentence. CharacTer calculates the character level edit
distance while performing the shift edit on word level. Unlike the strict matching criterion in TER, a hypothesis
word is considered to match a reference word and could be shifted, if the edit distance between them is below a
threshold value. The Levenshtein distance between the reference and the shifted hypothesis sequence is computed on the
character level. In addition, the lengths of hypothesis sequences instead of reference sequences are used for
normalizing the edit distance, which effectively counters the issue that shorter translations normally achieve lower
TER.
