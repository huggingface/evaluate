  Compute the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)
  
  The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a
  measure of the quality of binary and multiclass classifications. It takes
  into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally
  regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of
  very different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient value
  between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0
  an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction.  The statistic
  is also known as the phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]

# Metric Card for Matthews Correlation Coefficient

## Metric Description
The Matthews correlation coefficient is used in machine learning as a
measure of the quality of binary and multiclass classifications. It takes
into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally
regarded as a balanced measure which can be used even if the classes are of
very different sizes. The MCC is in essence a correlation coefficient value
between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0
an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction.  The statistic
is also known as the phi coefficient. [source: Wikipedia]

## How to Use
At minimum, this metric requires a list of predictions and a list of references:
```python
>>> matthews_metric = evaluate.load("matthews_correlation")
>>> results = matthews_metric.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[0, 1])
>>> print(results)
{'matthews_correlation': 1.0}
```

### Inputs
- **`predictions`** (`list` of `int`s): Predicted class labels.
- **`references`** (`list` of `int`s): Ground truth labels.
- **`sample_weight`** (`list` of `int`s, `float`s, or `bool`s): Sample weights. Defaults to `None`.
- **`average`**(`None` or `macro`): For the multilabel case, whether to return one correlation coefficient per feature (`average=None`), or the average of them (`average='macro'`). Defaults to `None`.

### Output Values
- **`matthews_correlation`** (`float` or `list` of `float`s): Matthews correlation coefficient, or list of them in the multilabel case without averaging.

The metric output takes the following form:
```python
{'matthews_correlation': 0.54}
```

This metric can be any value from -1 to +1, inclusive.

### Examples
A basic example with only predictions and references as inputs:
```python
>>> matthews_metric = evaluate.load("matthews_correlation")
>>> results = matthews_metric.compute(references=[1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2],
...                                     predictions=[1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3])
>>> print(results)
{'matthews_correlation': 0.5384615384615384}
```

The same example as above, but also including sample weights:
```python
>>> matthews_metric = evaluate.load("matthews_correlation")
>>> results = matthews_metric.compute(references=[1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2],
...                                     predictions=[1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3],
...                                     sample_weight=[0.5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2])
>>> print(results)
{'matthews_correlation': 0.09782608695652174}
```

The same example as above, with sample weights that cause a negative correlation:
```python
>>> matthews_metric = evaluate.load("matthews_correlation")
>>> results = matthews_metric.compute(references=[1, 3, 2, 0, 3, 2],
...                                     predictions=[1, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3],
...                                     sample_weight=[0.5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1])
>>> print(results)
{'matthews_correlation': -0.25}
```
