Computes Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS).
Args:
    predictions: List of question-answers dictionaries with the following key-values:
    - 'question_id': id of the question-answer pair as given in the references
    (see below)
    - 'prediction_text': the text of the answer
    references: List of question-answers dictionaries with the following key-values:
    - 'question_id': id of the question-answer pair (see above)
    - 'answers': list of possible texts for the answer, as a list of strings
Returns:
    'anls': The ANLS score of predicted tokens versus the gold answer
Examples:
    >>> predictions = [{'prediction_text': 'Denver Broncos',
                        'question_id': '56e10a3be'}]
    >>> references = [{'answers': ['Denver Broncos', 'Denver R. Broncos'],

    >>> results = anls_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
