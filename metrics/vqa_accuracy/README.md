# VQAaccuracy Metric Card

## Metric Description
The **VQAaccuracy** metric is used for evaluating the accuracy of visual question answering (VQA) models. It is designed to be robust to the variability in how different humans may phrase their answers. The accuracy for an answer (`ans`) predicted by the model is calculated as:
$ \text{Acc}(ans) = \min\left(\frac{\# \text{humans that said } ans}{3}, 1\right) $
This metric aligns with the official VQA evaluation by averaging the machine accuracies over all possible sets of human annotators.

## How to Use
The **VQAAccuracy** metric can be used to evaluate the performance of a VQA model by comparing the predicted answers to a set of ground truth answers. The metric can be integrated into your evaluation pipeline as follows:

### Inputs
- **predictions** (`list` of `str`): The predicted answers generated by the VQA model.
- **references** (`list` of `str` lists): The ground truth answers corresponding to each question.
- **answer_types** (`list` of `str`, *optional*): The types of answers corresponding to each question. If not provided, defaults to `None`.
- **question_types** (`list` of `str`, *optional*): The types of questions corresponding to each question. If not provided, defaults to `None`.

### Output Values
The output of this metric is a dictionary containing:
- **overall** (`float`): The overall VQA accuracy, rounded to the specified precision.
- **perAnswerType** (`dict`, *optional*): The VQA accuracy for each answer type, if provided.
- **perQuestionType** (`dict`, *optional*): The VQA accuracy for each question type, if provided.

The accuracy values range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better performance.

### Examples
Here is an example of how to use the **VQAaccuracy** metric:

```python
>>> from evaluate import load
>>> vqa_accuracy = load("Kamichanw/vqa_accuracy")
>>> predictions = ["yes", "2", "blue"]
>>> references = [["yes", "yeah", "yep"], ["2", "two"], ["blue", "bluish"]]
>>> results = vqa_accuracy.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
>>> print(results)
{"overall": 24.07}
```

## Limitations and Bias
The **VQAAccuracy** metric is dependent on the consistency and quality of the ground truth answers provided. Variability in human annotations can affect the accuracy scores. Additionally, the metric is designed specifically for the VQA task and may not generalize well to other types of question-answering models.

## Citation
If you use the **VQAAccuracy** metric in your work, please cite the original VQA paper:
