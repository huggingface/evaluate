_DESCRIPTION = """\
The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of generated images from generative adversarial networks (GANs). It measures the similarity between the feature representations of real and generated images.

FID is calculated by first extracting feature vectors from a pre-trained Inception-v3 network for both the real and generated images. Then, it computes the mean and covariance matrix of these feature vectors for each set. Finally, it calculates the Fr√©chet distance between these multivariate Gaussian distributions.

A lower FID score indicates a higher similarity between the real and generated images, suggesting better performance of the GAN in generating realistic images.

For further details, please refer to the paper:
"GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium"
by Heusel et al., presented at the Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference in 2017.
