# Metric Card for peqeval

## Metric description

The poseval metric can be used to evaluate POS taggers. Since seqeval does not work well with POS data (see e.g. [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71327693/how-to-disable-seqeval-label-formatting-for-pos-tagging)) that is not in IOB format the poseval is an alternative. It treats each token in the dataset as independant observation and computes the precision, recall and F1-score irrespective of sentences. It uses scikit-learns's [classification report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) to compute the scores.


## How to use 

Poseval produces labelling scores along with its sufficient statistics from a source against references.

It takes two mandatory arguments:

`predictions`: a list of lists of predicted labels, i.e. estimated targets as returned by a tagger.

`references`: a list of lists of reference labels, i.e. the ground truth/target values.

It can also take several optional arguments:

`zero_division`: Which value to substitute as a metric value when encountering zero division. Should be one of [`0`,`1`,`"warn"`]. `"warn"` acts as `0`, but the warning is raised.


```python
>>> predictions = [['INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'PUNCT', 'INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'VERB', 'SYM']]
>>> references = [['INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'PUNCT', 'INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'SYM']]
>>> poseval = evaluate.load("poseval")
>>> results = poseval.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
>>> print(list(results.keys()))
['ADP', 'INTJ', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'PUNCT', 'SYM', 'VERB', 'accuracy', 'macro avg', 'weighted avg']
>>> print(results["accuracy"])
0.8
>>> print(results["PROPN"]["recall"])
0.5
```

## Output values

This metric returns a a classification report as a dictionary with a summary of scores for overall and per type:

Overall (weighted and macro avg):

`accuracy`: the average [accuracy](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy), on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.
    
`precision`: the average [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.
    
`recall`: the average [recall](https://huggingface.co/metrics/recall), on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.

`f1`: the average [F1 score](https://huggingface.co/metrics/f1), which is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. It also has a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.

Per type (e.g. `MISC`, `PER`, `LOC`,...):

`precision`: the average [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.

`recall`: the average [recall](https://huggingface.co/metrics/recall), on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.

`f1`: the average [F1 score](https://huggingface.co/metrics/f1), on a scale between 0.0 and 1.0.


## Examples 

```python
>>> predictions = [['INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'NOUN', 'PUNCT', 'INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'VERB', 'SYM']]
>>> references = [['INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'PUNCT', 'INTJ', 'ADP', 'PROPN', 'PROPN', 'SYM']]
>>> poseval = evaluate.load("poseval")
>>> results = poseval.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
>>> print(list(results.keys()))
['ADP', 'INTJ', 'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'PUNCT', 'SYM', 'VERB', 'accuracy', 'macro avg', 'weighted avg']
>>> print(results["accuracy"])
0.8
>>> print(results["PROPN"]["recall"])
0.5
```

## Limitations and bias

In contrast to [seqeval](https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval), the poseval metric treats each token independently and computes the classification report over all concatenated sequences..
