_DESCRIPTION = """\
DARPA commissioned NIST to develop an MT evaluation facility based on the BLEU
score. The official script used by NIST to compute BLEU and NIST score is
mteval-14.pl. The main differences are:

 - BLEU uses geometric mean of the ngram precisions, NIST uses arithmetic mean.
 - NIST has a different brevity penalty
 - NIST score from mteval-14.pl has a self-contained tokenizer (in the Hugging Face implementation we rely on NLTK's
implementation of the NIST-specific tokenizer)
"""


_KWARGS_DESCRIPTION = """
Computes NIST score of translated segments against one or more references.
Args:
    predictions: predictions to score (list of str)
    references: potentially multiple references for each prediction (list of str or list of list of str)
    n: highest n-gram order
    lowercase: whether to lowercase the data (only applicable if 'western_lang' is True)
    western_lang: whether the current language is a Western language, which will enable some specific tokenization
 rules with respect to, e.g., punctuation

Returns:
    'nist_mt': nist_mt score
Examples:
    >>> nist_mt = evaluate.load("nist_mt")
    >>> hypothesis = "It is a guide to action which ensures that the military always obeys the commands of the party"
    >>> reference1 = "It is a guide to action that ensures that the military will forever heed Party commands"
    >>> reference2 = "It is the guiding principle which guarantees the military forces always being under the command of the Party"
    >>> reference3 = "It is the practical guide for the army always to heed the directions of the party"
    >>> nist_mt.compute(predictions=[hypothesis], references=[[reference1, reference2, reference3]])
    {'nist_mt': 3.3709935957649324}
    >>> nist_mt.compute(predictions=[hypothesis], references=[reference1])
    {'nist_mt': 2.4477124183006533}
