ðŸ¤— Evaluate is a library that makes evaluating and comparing models and reporting their performance easier and more standardized. 

It currently contains:

- **implementations of dozens of popular metrics**: the existing metrics cover a variety of tasks spanning from NLP to Computer Vision, and include dataset-specific metrics for datasets. With a simple command like `accuracy = load("accuracy")`, get any of these metrics ready to use for evaluating a ML model in any framework (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX).
- **comparisons and measurements**: comparisons are used to measure the difference between models and measurements are tools to evaluate datasets.
- **an easy way of adding new evaluation modules to the ðŸ¤— Hub**: you can create new evaluation modules and push them to a dedicated Space in the ðŸ¤— Hub with `evaluate-cli create [metric name]`, which allows you to see easily compare different metrics and their outputs for the same sets of references and predictions.

ðŸ”Ž **Find a [metric](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-metric), [comparison](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-comparison), [measurement](https://huggingface.co/evaluate-measurement) on the Hub**

[ðŸŒŸ **Add a new evaluation module**](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/)

ðŸ¤— Evaluate also has lots of useful features like:

- **Type checking**: the input types are checked to make sure that you are using the right input formats for each metric
- **Metric cards**: each metrics comes with a card that describes the values, limitations and their ranges, as well as providing examples of their usage and usefulness.
- **Community metrics:** Metrics live on the Hugging Face Hub and you can easily add your own metrics for your project or to collaborate with others.


# Installation

## With pip

ðŸ¤— Evaluate can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)

```bash
pip install evaluate
```

# Usage

ðŸ¤— Evaluate's main methods are:

- `evaluate.list_evaluation_modules()` to list the available metrics, comparisons and measurements
- `evaluate.load(module_name, **kwargs)` to instantiate an evaluation module
- `results = module.compute(*kwargs)` to compute the result of an evaluation module

# Adding a new evaluation module

First install the necessary dependencies to create a new metric with the following command:
```bash
pip install evaluate[template]
```
Then you can get started with the following command which will create a new folder for your metric and display the necessary steps:
```bash
evaluate-cli create "Awesome Metric"
```
See this [step-by-step guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/creating_and_sharing) in the documentation for detailed instructions.
